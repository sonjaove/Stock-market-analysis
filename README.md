# Stock market analysis
- This repo consists of a stock market model for the year 2018-2022, the target vraible is closing price with all the other variables being the determiners of the closing price.
- Another dataset was also used to check the viability of the model.
- a simple linear regression model is used as a model
## Feautres :
- the trends are clearly visible from the plots
- the trend seen is that, stock makrket goes down for first few initial months of the year and then gradually grows only to decrese near new year(and for a few months) however this trend is not followed for 2021 only.
- Volume is a storng variable as all the others depend on it except date
## Questions :
1. How did a linear model work well wiht an unpredictible thing as stock market? (probable reason is that, we do not have Evey minutes data, i.e it is a complete dataset in the sense that we have 4 years of ready data, we do not have to predict "next minute's" data as such)
2. Why were graphs reacting weirdly when volume was inculcated in any of graph(except the candlestick plot)?
